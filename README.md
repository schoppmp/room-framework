# ROOM Framework

This repository contains implementations of MPC protocols for computations on sparse data. For a full description of the protocols and applications please have a look at the [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/281).
The code published here is highly experimental, unstable, insecure and work-in-progress! Use at your own risk!

## Requirements

- [bazel](https://bazel.build)
- OCaml, OPAM, and the packages required by [Obliv-C](https://github.com/samee/obliv-c). In the future, these can hopefully be downloaded and compiled by Bazel. If you want to contribute in that direction, feel free to open a pull request in [rules_oblivc](https://github.com/schoppmp/rules_oblivc).
